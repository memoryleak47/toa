All Clients send Commands to Server
-> Server sends them to (all / the other) Clients.

One binary executable with possibly command line arguments.

Multiple Clients.

Server-program starts same program again, with `server` CLI args, and connects to localhost?

CLI: Spielkonstellation: local + ai vs local + inet
host A: "host"
host B: "over inet"

A: "host { local: red, ai: red, local: blue, inet: blue }"
A: "server { local: red, ai: red, local: blue, inet: blue }"
B: "join '192.168...'"
A: "{ local: red, ai: red, local: blue, inet: blue }" => B

idea: every player (slot) is a new program
- the server has a Vec<IpConnection>, for which it listenes for actions
	These IpConnections may be other local programs or other distant computers
